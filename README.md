# Rule34-Blacklist-Filter
This a modification of Mango 2's userscript, Danbooru - Miscellaneous Tweaks, but with a few tweaks to it for the Blacklist function to work with Rule34.xxx

# [Install script](https://github.com/Donny-Pandairaz/Rule34-Blacklist-Filter/blob/main/Rule34%20-%20Miscellaneous%20Tweaks.user.js)
This modification was done by someone with no coding experience so expect something to break somewhere down the line... I just wanted to do this because there have been many userscripts for various features except a localized blacklist. This was tested in Tampermonkey.

# Things to do
I kinda want to see if I get the rest of the settings to work but at the moment it is not a priority. I really only need to figure out how to get the image swapping to work.

# Shoutouts
